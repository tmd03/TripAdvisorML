# TripAdvisorML
ML project in Zerobase

## Abstract 
-----
## Setup
To run the experiment, install the required packages.

Python==3.12.3 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-----
## Data preperation
### 1) Augmentation
Use the `Augmentation` folder inside `Dataset Building` to augment data using the provided pre-augmentation dataset and related scripts. The final dataset is created by merging manually collected and augmented data.

**Augmentation Tasks:**
- Kor Letter Rotation
- Kor Visual Transform

```bash
Dataset_Building/Augmentation/kor_letter_rotation_rule.ipynb
```
> Applies transformation rules for the Korean Letter Rotation Task dataset augmentation.

```bash
Dataset_Building/Augmentation/kor_visual_transform_rule.ipynb
```
> Applies transformation rules for the Korean Visual Transform Task dataset augmentation. Manual inspection ensures no redundant transformations are applied.

### 2) Preprocessing
To finalize the dataset for the experiment, preprocess the collected and augmented raw data. The sources of the raw dataset are documented in the research paper.

```bash
Dataset_Building/Augmentation/eng_phonetic_preprocessing.ipynb
```
> Filters phonetic similarity data for the English Phonetic Substitution task using the `double metaphone` algorithm.

```bash
Dataset_Building/Augmentation/eng_abbreviation_preprocessing.ipynb
```
> Filters abbreviation-compliant data for the English Abbreviation task using the appropriate rules.

```bash
Dataset_Building/eng_split_letters.ipynb
```
> Splits collected English words into consonants and vowels for the English Consonant & Vowel Combination task.

```bash
Dataset_Building/kor_split_letters.ipynb
```
> Splits collected Korean words into consonants and vowels for the Korean Consonant & Vowel Combination task.

-----
## Run
The constructed dataset is stored in the `Dataset` folder. Use this dataset along with the models in the `Task` folder to evaluate LLMs' word restoration capabilities.
📌 **GPT o3-mini** is only used for error case analysis in this study.

### Available Prompts
The `prompts.json` file contains prompts for Zero-shot, CoT (Chain-of-Thought), and CoT+ICL (In-Context Learning) settings.

```bash
Task/gpt4o_batch.ipynb
Task/gemini.ipynb
Task/claude_batch.ipynb
Task/gpto3mini.ipynb
```

-----
## Evaluation Preprocessing
Before evaluating LLM responses, preprocessing is performed using the scripts in the `Preprocessing` folder.

```bash
Preprocessing/answer_split.ipynb
```
> Parses the original words from the full responses of LLMs based on the predefined `Answer format` in the prompt.

```bash
Preprocessing/abbreviation_preprocessing.ipynb
```
> For English and Korean abbreviation tasks, LLMs generate five responses. This script selects the most similar response to the ground truth for evaluation.

-----
## Evaluation
Assess the performance of different models and analyze the results.

```bash
Evaluating/evaluation_main_task.ipynb
```
> Evaluates model performance for the main task.

```bash
Evaluating/evaluation_main_task_eng_consonant_vowel.ipynb
```
> Uses a different evaluation standard for the English Consonant & Vowel Combination task.

**Failure Case Analysis** can be performed using the following scripts:

```bash
Evaluating/evaluation_failure_case.ipynb
```
> Analyzes GPT o3-mini failure cases and compares them with other models.

```bash
Evaluating/evaluation_failure_case_eng_consonant_vowel.ipynb
```
> Uses a different evaluation standard for failure cases in the English Consonant & Vowel Combination task.
